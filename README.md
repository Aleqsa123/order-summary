## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media query


### What I learned

This challenge was very important in understanding responsive design. I learned mobile-first workflow and doing breakouts. I also understood "margin: auto;", paddings and box-sizing much better. I studied google fonts import method in CSS.

I love this CSS code because of margin understanding
.main {
    height: 570px;
    width: 327px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #FFFFFF;
    box-shadow: 0px 40px 40px -20px rgba(13, 48, 189, 0.151826);
    margin-top: 71px;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-bottom: 71px;
    margin-left: auto;
}

and this one, for fonts import learning:
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Red+Hat+Display:wght@500;700;900&display=swap');

Media query code is also important at this stage of study:
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
    body {
        background-image: url(./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: top, right;
        Width: 100vw;
    }


### Continued development

Getting data from figma design and use them properly with HTML elements would be great. Also I have to learn more about boxes and how they behave in different "display" situation.

### Useful resources

(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing site which helped me in styling some text and layout boxes.
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN4vDtGuDvg&t=558s) - This is also a v-log by Nika, which explains well how to layout card content and to handle responsive design.
